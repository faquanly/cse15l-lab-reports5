   - I've learned many useful and cool things from the lab tasks and lab reports from the second half of this quater. They are `bash script`, `vim editor`, `git`, `gitHub`, `jdb`, etc., which I was very interesting to learn. Eventhought I used a little bit `vim editor`, `git` commands, `gitHub` in my previous classes, but I was struggling to understand and use them confidently. Thank to this class, I understand more and know how to develop my knowledge in using these tools. It is very cool to know how to use `jdb` in debugging and `bash cript` in running java and other command lines which I did not know before.
