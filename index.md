1. Part 1 - Debugging Scenario
   Design a debugging scenario, and write a report as a conversation on Edstem:
   - [a] The origional post from a student with a screenshot showing a symtom and a description of a guess at the bug/some sense of what the failure-inducing input is: "Hi, I am running grade.sh in skill_demo3_data, but I don't see anything written in run-result.txt file. Could you check where is the bug in my `grade.sh` file?"
   - ![ Here is the grade.sh when I run the code](lab5-1-1)
   - ![ Here is `run-result.txt file` after running the code without anything written in it](lab5-1-2)
   - ![ Here is `compile-errors.txt file` after running the code to compared with ](lab5-1-3)
   - [b] A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try.
   - [c] Another screenshot/ terminal output showing what information the student got from trying that, and a clear description of what the bug is.
   ![screenshot from trying to fix the bug](lab5-1-2)
   - [d] At the end, all the information needed about the setup:
   - The file and directory structure needed.
   - The contents of each file before fixing the bug.
   - A description of what to edit to fix the bug
1. Part 2 - Reflection
   - I've learned many useful and cool things from the lab tasks and lab reports from the second half of this quater. They are `bash script`, `vim editor`, `git`, `gitHub`, `jdb`, etc., which I was very interesting to learn. Eventhought I used a little bit `vim editor`, `git` commands, `gitHub` in my previous classes, but I was struggling to understand and use them confidently. Thank to this class, I understand more and know how to develop my knowledge in using these tools. It is very cool to know how to use `jdb` in debugging and `bash cript` in running java and other command lines which I did not know before. I also thank to the tutors for helping me do lab tasks and find the way to debug. Overall, I found this class is extremely useful and necessary for programmer.
